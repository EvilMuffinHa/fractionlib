# fractionlib
A small library for fractions in python

## Requirements
Python 3.6

## Running

To run, import the module in your python file with `from fractionlib.Fraction import Fraction, simplification`.  
Then you can create a `Fraction` object with the numerator and denominator like this:  
`x = Fraction(2, 3)`.
You can perform basic arithmetic and comparisons using the Fraction objects, and you can print them.
